# DinoAir Free Tier - Configuration Fixes Documentation

This document details the configuration changes made to resolve installation and runtime issues with the DinoAir Free Tier web interface.

## Overview

Two critical issues were identified and resolved:

1. **Chat Backend Not Connected** - The Ollama integration was missing, preventing the chat functionality from working
2. **Artifacts System Error** - JSON parsing errors in localStorage were causing the artifacts system to crash

## Detailed Fix Documentation

### 1. Chat Backend Not Connected - Ollama Integration

#### Issue Description
The chat interface showed "Backend not connected" because there was no API endpoint to connect the frontend to the Ollama service running locally.

#### Solution Implemented

##### New File Created: `web-gui/app/api/chat/route.ts`

This new API route acts as a proxy between the frontend and Ollama:

```typescript
// Key features of the implementation:
- POST endpoint at /api/chat
- Proxies requests to http://localhost:11434/api/generate
- Handles streaming responses from Ollama
- Manages connection errors gracefully
- Configurable model selection
```

Key implementation details:
- Accepts messages from the frontend
- Formats requests for Ollama's API
- Streams responses back to the client in real-time
- Handles errors with appropriate HTTP status codes

##### Updated File: `web-gui/components/dinoair-gui/LocalChatView.tsx`

Changes made:
- Replaced placeholder `setTimeout` mock code with actual API calls
- Implemented proper fetch to `/api/chat` endpoint
- Added streaming response handling with ReadableStream
- Enhanced error handling for connection failures
- Improved UI feedback during message processing

### 2. Artifacts System Error - localStorage JSON Parsing

#### Issue Description
The artifacts system would crash with JSON parsing errors when localStorage contained corrupted or invalid data.

#### Solution Implemented

##### Updated File: `web-gui/components/dinoair-gui/LocalArtifactsView.tsx`

Implemented robust error handling:

```typescript
// Key improvements:
- Wrapped JSON.parse() in try-catch blocks
- Added isValidArtifact() validation function
- Implemented automatic recovery from corrupted data
- Added "Clear All" button for manual reset
- Temporary error messages that auto-clear after 5 seconds
```

Data validation ensures artifacts have:
- Valid ID
- Title string
- Type string (text/code/image/etc.)
- Content or imageUrl
- Creation timestamp

### 3. Additional Fixes

#### Missing Dependency: tailwindcss-animate

During testing, a missing dependency was discovered and installed:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss-animate
```

This package is required for animation utilities used in the UI components.

#### Model Configuration Update

The Ollama model configuration was updated:
- **Initial**: `llama3.2:latest`
- **Updated to**: `qwen:7b-chat-v1.5-q4_K_M`

This change was necessary to match the available models in the user's Ollama installation.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Backend not connected" Error

**Symptoms**: Chat interface shows connection error

**Solutions**:
- Verify Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Check if Ollama is accessible: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Ensure the correct model is installed: `ollama pull qwen:7b-chat-v1.5-q4_K_M`
- Check the API route file exists: `web-gui/app/api/chat/route.ts`

#### 2. Artifacts Not Saving/Loading

**Symptoms**: Artifacts disappear on refresh or show errors

**Solutions**:
- Click "Clear All" button to reset localStorage
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify localStorage is not disabled in browser settings
- Try in an incognito/private window to rule out extensions

#### 3. Chat Responses Not Streaming

**Symptoms**: Messages appear all at once instead of streaming

**Solutions**:
- Verify the API route is using proper streaming headers
- Check network tab in browser DevTools for response type
- Ensure Ollama supports streaming (most models do by default)

#### 4. Model Not Found Error

**Symptoms**: Chat returns error about missing model

**Solutions**:
- List available models: `ollama list`
- Pull required model: `ollama pull qwen:7b-chat-v1.5-q4_K_M`
- Update model name in `route.ts` if using different model
- Restart the Next.js development server after changes

## Configuration Requirements

### Ollama Model Configuration

**Important**: The model specified in the API route must match an available Ollama model.

To check available models:
```bash
ollama list
```

To update the model in code:
1. Edit `web-gui/app/api/chat/route.ts`
2. Find the line with `model: "qwen:7b-chat-v1.5-q4_K_M"`
3. Replace with your available model name
4. Save and restart the development server

### Recommended Models

For best performance with DinoAir Free Tier:
- `qwen:7b-chat-v1.5-q4_K_M` - Balanced performance
- `llama3.2:latest` - Good for general chat
- `mistral:7b-instruct` - Fast responses
- `codellama:7b` - Better for code-related queries

### Port Configuration

Default ports used:
- Next.js Web GUI: `http://localhost:3000`
- Ollama API: `http://localhost:11434`
- ComfyUI: `http://localhost:8188`

Ensure these ports are not blocked by firewall or other applications.

## Testing Checklist

After implementing these fixes, verify:

- [ ] Chat interface connects without errors
- [ ] Messages stream properly in real-time
- [ ] Artifacts can be created and saved
- [ ] Artifacts persist after page refresh
- [ ] Clear All button works correctly
- [ ] Error messages display and auto-clear
- [ ] Ollama model is correctly configured

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
1. Model selection dropdown in chat interface
2. Automatic Ollama model detection
3. Persistent chat history across sessions
4. Export/import functionality for artifacts
5. Better error recovery mechanisms
6. Connection status indicator with retry logic
