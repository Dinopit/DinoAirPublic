## Bug Details

### BUG-001: CRITICAL - Web UI PrismJS Syntax Highlighting Failure

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Component**: Web UI / Frontend  
**Reported**: July 22, 2025

#### Description
The web UI fails to load completely due to a PrismJS error, resulting in a blank/broken interface that prevents all web-based functionality. This is a complete showstopper that makes the application unusable through the web interface.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install DinoAir Free Tier to `D:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic`
2. Run `python start.py`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8188` in a web browser
4. Observe the broken UI

#### Expected Behavior
The web UI should load completely with all interface elements functional, allowing users to:
- Upload images
- Configure generation parameters
- Execute workflows
- View results

#### Actual Behavior
- Web page loads but displays a broken/incomplete interface
- JavaScript console shows PrismJS-related errors
- No interactive elements are functional
- Cannot perform any operations through the web interface

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Uncaught Error: PrismJS syntax highlighting failed
TypeError: Cannot read property 'highlight' of undefined
```

#### Potential Fix or Workaround
1. **Immediate Workaround**: Use API endpoints directly with tools like Postman or curl (if authentication can be resolved)
2. **Fix Options**:
   - Update PrismJS to a compatible version
   - Remove PrismJS dependency if syntax highlighting is not critical
   - Add proper error handling and fallback for PrismJS failures
   - Ensure all JavaScript dependencies are properly bundled and loaded

#### Screenshots/Evidence
*Web UI completely broken - blank or partially rendered interface*

### BUG-002: HIGH - VAE Model Download Size Mismatch

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Model Management / Download System  
**Reported**: July 22, 2025

#### Description
The VAE model download fails due to a file size mismatch between the expected size and the actual downloaded file. This prevents proper model initialization and affects image generation quality.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start DinoAir with `python start.py`
2. System attempts to download VAE model
3. Download completes but verification fails
4. Error message displays size mismatch

#### Expected Behavior
- VAE model should download completely
- File size should match: 334,643,268 bytes
- Model should be verified and loaded successfully

#### Actual Behavior
- Download appears to complete
- Actual file size: 334,641,164 bytes (2,104 bytes short)
- Verification fails preventing model usage
- May result in corrupted outputs or generation
#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Error: VAE model size mismatch
Expected: 334,643,268 bytes
Actual: 334,641,164 bytes
Difference: -2,104 bytes
Download may be corrupted or incomplete
```

#### Potential Fix or Workaround
1. **Immediate Workaround**: 
   - Manually download the VAE model from the official source
   - Place in `ComfyUI\models\vae\` directory
   - Verify checksum/hash if available
2. **Fix Options**:
   - Implement retry logic with resume capability
   - Add multiple mirror/CDN options for downloads
   - Implement proper checksum verification (MD5/SHA256)
   - Consider compression for large model transfers
   - Add progress indication with integrity checks

#### Screenshots/Evidence
*File size mismatch error in console output*

### BUG-003: HIGH - Missing API Authentication Documentation

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: API / Documentation  
**Reported**: July 22, 2025

#### Description
The API endpoints are exposed but there is no documentation on how to authenticate or use them. This prevents programmatic access to DinoAir functionality, which is especially critical given the broken web UI.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Attempt to access API endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8188/api/generate`)
2. Receive authentication error or unclear response
3. Search documentation for API authentication methods
4. Find no documentation available

#### Expected Behavior
- Clear API documentation should be available
- Authentication methods should be documented (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Example requests should be provided
- Error responses should be informative

#### Actual Behavior
- No API documentation found in installation
- Authentication requirements unclear
- API endpoints return cryptic errors
- No examples or guides available

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
401 Unauthorized
{"error": "Authentication required"}
```

#### Potential Fix or Workaround
1. **Immediate Workaround**: 
   - Check if authentication can be disabled for local testing
   - Look for configuration files that might contain API settings
   - Try common authentication methods (Bearer tokens, API keys)
2. **Fix Options**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add API authentication setup to installation guide
   - Provide example code in multiple languages
   - Implement interactive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Add authentication configuration to setup wizard

#### Screenshots/Evidence
*Missing API documentation and authentication errors*

### BUG-004: MEDIUM - Incorrect ComfyUI Path in start.py

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Component**: Startup Script / Configuration  
**Reported**: July 22, 2025

#### Description
The [`start.py`](d:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic\start.py) script looks for ComfyUI in the parent directory instead of the current installation directory, causing startup failures or requiring manual path adjustments.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install DinoAir to `D:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic`
2. Run `python start.py`
3. Observe path-related errors
4. Script searches in `D:\TestInstall\ComfyUI` instead of `D:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic\ComfyUI`

#### Expected Behavior
- Script should use relative paths from its own location
- Should find ComfyUI in `./ComfyUI` relative to start.py
- Should work regardless of installation directory

#### Actual Behavior
- Script uses incorrect path resolution
- Looks for ComfyUI in parent directory
- Requires manual path correction or specific installation structure

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Error: ComfyUI directory not found at ..\ComfyUI
Looking in: D:\TestInstall\ComfyUI
Should be: D:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic\ComfyUI
```

#### Potential Fix or Workaround
1. **Immediate Workaround**: 
   - Edit [`start.py`](d:\TestInstall\DinoAirPublic\start.py) to use correct path
   - Use absolute path to ComfyUI directory
   - Run from specific directory that makes relative path work
2. **Fix Options**:
   ```python
   # Current (incorrect)
   comfyui_path = os.path.join("..", "ComfyUI")
   
   # Fixed (correct)
   script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   comfyui_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "ComfyUI")
   ```

#### Screenshots/Evidence
*Path resolution errors in startup script*

### BUG-005: MEDIUM - Missing SD 1.5 Model Required by Default Workflow

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Component**: Model Management / Default Configuration  
**Reported**: July 22, 2025

#### Description
The default workflow expects `v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors` model but this is not included in the installation or automatically downloaded, causing workflow execution failures.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Complete DinoAir installation
2. Attempt to run default workflow
3. Receive error about missing model
4. Check `ComfyUI\models\checkpoints\` directory - model not present

#### Expected Behavior
- Default workflow should work out-of-the-box
- Required models should be included or auto-downloaded
- Clear instructions for obtaining required models
- Workflow should gracefully handle missing models

#### Actual Behavior
- Default workflow fails immediately
- No automatic download of required model
- No clear instructions on where to obtain model
- Error messages don't provide helpful guidance

#### Error Messages/Logs
```
Error: Required model not found: v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors
Please place model in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints\
Workflow execution failed
```

#### Potential Fix or Workaround
1. **Immediate Workaround**: 
   - Download SD 1.5 model from Hugging Face
   - Place in `ComfyUI\models\checkpoints\`
   - Rename to expected filename if necessary
2. **Fix Options**:
   - Include model download in installation process
   - Provide direct download links in documentation
   - Create model downloader utility
   - Offer alternative lightweight default workflow
   - Add model presence validation during startup

#### Screenshots/Evidence
*Missing model error when running default workflow*
