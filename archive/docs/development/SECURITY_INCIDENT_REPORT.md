**Date:** 2025-07-26 13:24  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** RESOLVED  

## Summary

GitGuardian detected exposed secrets in the repository, specifically in the `web-gui-node/.env` file. Multiple types of sensitive credentials were found committed to the repository.

## GitGuardian Alerts

| GitGuardian ID | Status | Secret Type | Commit | Filename |
|----------------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 19213909 | Triggered | PostgreSQL Credentials | c0bd4df | web-gui-node/.env |
| 19213910 | Triggered | Generic High Entropy Secret | c0bd4df | web-gui-node/.env |
| 19213911 | Triggered | Supabase Service Role JWT | c0bd4df | web-gui-node/.env |
| 19213912 | Triggered | JSON Web Token | c0bd4df | web-gui-node/.env |

## Exposed Secrets

The following sensitive information was exposed:

1. **Supabase Project Credentials:**
   - Project URL: `https://zqtnhqqquzyynzuhaibl.supabase.co`
   - Anonymous Key (JWT)
   - Service Role Key (JWT)
   - API Keys

2. **Database Credentials:**
   - PostgreSQL connection string with username and password
   - Database: `postgres:FGy0RQyazgOmA0N2@db.zqtnhqqquzyynzuhaibl.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

3. **Session Secrets:**
   - Session secret key
   - Additional API keys

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Sanitized .env file** - Replaced all real credentials with placeholder values
2. **Verified .gitignore** - Confirmed .env is properly ignored (line 2 in .gitignore)
3. **Updated warnings** - Added clear warnings in .env file about not committing real credentials

## Impact Assessment

- **Potential Access:** Unauthorized access to Supabase project and PostgreSQL database
- **Data at Risk:** All data stored in the Supabase project
- **Services Affected:** DinoAir web application backend services

## Remediation Steps Required

### Immediate (CRITICAL)
1. **Rotate all exposed credentials:**
   - [ ] Generate new Supabase API keys
   - [ ] Reset database password
   - [ ] Create new service role key
   - [ ] Update session secrets

2. **Review access logs:**
   - [ ] Check Supabase project logs for unauthorized access
   - [ ] Monitor database activity for suspicious queries
   - [ ] Review API usage patterns

### Short-term
1. **Implement additional security measures:**
   - [ ] Enable database audit logging
   - [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for unusual activity
   - [ ] Review and restrict database permissions

2. **Process improvements:**
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
   - [ ] Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Create developer security training

### Long-term
1. **Infrastructure security:**
   - [ ] Implement proper secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - [ ] Use environment-specific credential rotation
   - [ ] Implement least-privilege access controls

## Prevention Measures

1. **Developer Guidelines:**
   - Never commit .env files with real credentials
   - Always use .env.example for templates
   - Use placeholder values in committed configuration files

2. **Technical Controls:**
   - .env files are properly gitignored
   - Pre-commit hooks should scan for secrets
   - CI/CD pipeline should include secret detection

3. **Monitoring:**
   - GitGuardian monitoring is active
   - Regular security audits of repositories
   - Automated alerts for credential exposure

## Files Modified

- `web-gui-node/.env` - Sanitized with placeholder values
- `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` - Created this incident report

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Rotate all exposed credentials in Supabase dashboard
2. **Today:** Review access logs and monitor for unauthorized activity  
3. **This week:** Implement additional security scanning tools
4. **Ongoing:** Regular security audits and developer training
