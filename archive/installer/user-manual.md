### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Installation Fails with Permission Errors
**Problem**: Installer cannot write to selected directory
**Solution**: 
- Run installer with administrator/sudo privileges
- Choose a directory where you have write permissions
- On Windows: Right-click Command Prompt â†’ "Run as administrator"
- On macOS/Linux: Use `sudo node index.js`

#### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"
**Problem**: Python not found during installation
**Solution**:
- Install Python 3.7+ from python.org
- Ensure Python is added to system PATH
- On Windows: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Verify with: `python --version` or `python3 --version`

#### "Node.js version too old"
**Problem**: Installed Node.js version is below 14.0.0
**Solution**:
- Update Node.js from nodejs.org
- Use Node Version Manager (nvm) for multiple versions
- Verify with: `node --version`

#### Network Timeouts During Model Download
**Problem**: AI model download fails or times out
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection stability
- Try installation during off-peak hours
- Use smaller AI model if bandwidth is limited
- Installer will automatically retry failed downloads

#### Insufficient Disk Space
**Problem**: Not enough space for installation
**Solution**:
- Free up disk space (minimum 10GB recommended)
- Choose smaller AI model
- Select different installation directory with more space
- Clean temporary files and downloads

#### Installation Hangs or Freezes
**Problem**: Installer stops responding
**Solution**:
- Wait for current operation to complete (downloads can take time)
- Check system resources (CPU, memory usage)
- Restart installer if completely frozen
- Use debug mode: `node index.js --debug`

A: Yes, DinoAir supports headless operation. Use the web interface to access functionality remotely.

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better Performance
- Use SSD storage for installation directory
- Ensure adequate RAM for selected AI model
- Close unnecessary applications during use
- Consider GPU acceleration if available

#### For Lower Resource Usage
- Choose smaller AI models (Qwen2-VL-2B)
- Limit concurrent operations
- Use headless mode on servers
- Adjust quality settings in configuration

### Security Considerations

#### Network Security
- DinoAir runs locally by default
- Web interface accessible only from localhost
- No data sent to external servers without consent

#### File Permissions
- Installation directory should have appropriate permissions
- Avoid running as root/administrator unless necessary
- Regular security updates recommended

### Backup and Recovery

#### What to Backup
- Configuration files in `config/` directory
- Generated images and projects
- Custom AI models (if added)
- User preferences and settings

#### Recovery Process
- Reinstall DinoAir using the same version
- Restore configuration files
- Verify all models are properly loaded
- Test functionality before resuming work
